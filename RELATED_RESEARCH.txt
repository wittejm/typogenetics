Related Research: Mutual Pairs and Hypercycles in Typogenetics
=============================================================

The concept of mutual pairs -- two strands that produce each other -- is
well-established in the (admittedly niche) typogenetics literature, where
the standard term is "hypercycle." A 2-hypercycle is exactly what this
project calls a "pair bond" or "mutual pair": strand A produces B, and B
produces A.

The term "hypercycle" comes from Eigen & Schuster's origin-of-life theory
(1970s), which Hofstadter was certainly aware of when designing
typogenetics. Mutual reproduction is arguably *the* interesting question
once you get past self-replication.

   The foundational paper. Models autoreplicating molecules and systems of
   mutually replicating molecules (hypercycles) using Hofstadter's
   typogenetics. Key finding: a 2-molecule hypercycle (mutual pair) can be
   found "without extreme difficulties," but hypercycles of more than 4
   autoreplicators are "nearly impossible" to construct simultaneously.
   They used evolutionary algorithms (genetic search) rather than
   exhaustive enumeration.

   Conference chapter expanding on the 2001 paper. Demonstrates that
   larger hypercycles can be constructed incrementally -- optimize a
   2-cycle first, then expand by adding new molecules into the existing
   cycle. This sequential approach substantially reduces combinatorial
   complexity compared to simultaneous optimization.

Notes
-----

The existing literature relies on evolutionary algorithms (guided search)
to find hypercycles. This project's headless search takes the brute-force
exhaustive approach instead, enumerating all strands up to a given length.
The tradeoffs are obvious: exhaustive search is complete but slow (4^N
growth); evolutionary search is fast but may miss solutions.

Crucially, Kvasnička & Pospíchal used a SIMPLIFIED typogenetics that
removes insert and delete operations, keeping strand lengths fixed through
replication. This is a fundamentally different system than Hofstadter's
full rules (which this project implements). Their finding that
2-hypercycles can be found "without extreme difficulty" applies to this
constrained variant where mutual production is much more achievable --
when strands can't change length, the output space is far smaller and
a strand is much more likely to land back on its partner.

This project's exhaustive search has completed through all strands of
length 1-15 (over 1.4 billion strands) under full Hofstadter rules and
found ZERO pair bonds. The contrast with the literature's optimism is
striking and almost certainly explained by the insert/delete difference.

Note also that this project's pairBond check (in classify.ts) is narrower
than a general 2-hypercycle: it only tests whether a strand and its
reverse complement mutually produce each other, not arbitrary A ↔ B pairs.
The soup worker's mutual pair detection (in soup/worker.ts) does check
for arbitrary mutual pairs in the population, which is the more general
case.

Specific strand lengths from the literature are unknown -- the details
are behind paywalls. They used evolutionary algorithms on longer strands
than brute-force would reach, and Gwak & Wee (2007) mention
"experimenting with enzymes of different lengths," suggesting they
parameterized strand length, but no numbers appear in the abstracts.
