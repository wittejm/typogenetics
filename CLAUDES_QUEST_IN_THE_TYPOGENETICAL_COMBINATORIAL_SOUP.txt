CLAUDE'S QUEST IN THE TYPOGENETICAL COMBINATORIAL SOUP
=======================================================

PROBLEM SPACE
-------------

Hofstadter's typogenetics defines a system where strings of bases (A, C, G, T)
encode enzymes that operate on other strings. The "combinatorial soup" model
throws many strands into a shared pool and lets them interact randomly:

  1. Pick a random source strand, translate it to enzymes
  2. Pick a random target strand
  3. Bind the enzyme to a matching base on the target
  4. Execute the enzyme (cut, delete, insert, copy, move, search...)
  5. Collect result strands, return them to the pool
  6. Repeat

This is fundamentally different from self-operation (where a strand's enzymes
act on itself). Here, strand A's enzyme acts on strand B. A strand's survival
depends not on what it does to itself, but on the ecological web of cross-strand
interactions. The unit of interest is the RELATIONSHIP, not the individual.

The central question: does this system produce emergent ecological structure,
or is it just entropy?


WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
----------------------

Interesting findings roughly ordered by how exciting they'd be:

1. AUTOCATALYTIC SETS
   A group of strands that collectively sustain all their members through
   cross-catalysis. A's enzyme produces B (from some substrate), B's enzyme
   produces C, C's enzyme produces A. The group is self-sustaining even though
   no individual strand self-replicates. This would be the holy grail.

2. STABLE MUTUAL PAIRS
   The simplest autocatalytic set: A's enzyme produces B, B's enzyme produces A.
   Not just a coincidental blip but a persistent relationship over thousands of
   ops. Do they form? Do they resist invasion by other strands?

3. PARASITISM
   Strand A benefits from B's enzyme activity (B produces A) but A's enzymes
   don't reciprocate — A either produces junk or actively destroys B. Does the
   parasite kill its host? Do resistant hosts evolve?

4. HUB STRANDS
   Strands whose enzymes are unusually productive — they produce many different
   strands from various substrates. Or strands that are produced by many
   different catalysts (convergent production). What structural property makes
   a strand a hub?

5. STABLE ATTRACTORS
   Does the pool converge to a fixed set of strands regardless of initial
   conditions? Or does it diverge chaotically? Are there basins of attraction?

6. THE ROLE OF COPY MODE
   Enzymes with the "cop" amino activate copy mode, producing complementary
   secondary strands. Does copy mode play a disproportionate role in interesting
   dynamics? Are the most productive enzymes the ones that copy?

7. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS
   Do surviving strands share structural properties? Common subsequences,
   specific lengths, particular duplet compositions? Is there a "grammar" of
   fit strands?


DEGENERATE DYNAMICS TO WATCH FOR
---------------------------------

Known failure modes that produce boring pools:

- FRAGMENTATION DEATH: Without "filter inert," the pool fills with length-1
  strands that can't produce enzymes. They're immortal junk. Solution: always
  filter inert.

- RUNAWAY LENGTH INFLATION: "Evict shortest" selects purely for length. Strands
  grow without bound, all unique, zero convergence. No ecological structure.

- RAPID EXTINCTION: "Consume source" with a small pool kills everything fast.
  No time for structure to emerge.

- RANDOM NOISE: Without eviction pressure on a growing pool, everything is
  so dilute that repeat interactions never happen. Structure requires density.


METHODOLOGY
-----------

Phase 1: Headless Simulation (TypeScript)

  Write a Node script (run via tsx) that imports the existing model code and
  runs the soup loop. Unlike the browser worker, this version logs FULL DATA:

  - Every operation: (catalyst, enzyme_aminos, substrate, bind_position, products[])
  - Pool snapshots at regular intervals
  - Running tallies of production edges (catalyst -> product, with substrate)

  Output structured JSON to files. Run for 50k-200k ops per experiment.

  Configurations to sweep:
  - Filter inert: always ON (we know OFF is degenerate)
  - Eviction: none, random@200, random@500, oldest@200
  - Consume source: on vs off
  - Initial pool: default 13 strands, also try larger random pools

Phase 2: Visualization (Python + matplotlib + networkx)

  Read the JSON output. Render:

  a) PRODUCTION GRAPH — force-directed layout of the catalytic network.
     Nodes = strands in pool, edges = production relationships, edge weight =
     frequency. Color nodes by: in-degree (how many things produce it),
     out-degree (how many things it produces), strand length, pool frequency.

  b) POOL COMPOSITION OVER TIME — stacked area chart or heatmap showing which
     strands dominate the pool at each time window.

  c) CYCLE DETECTION — highlight cycles in the production graph. Mutual pairs
     (length-2 cycles), triangles (length-3), etc. Color them distinctly.

  d) CATALYST vs PRODUCT PROFILES — for each strand, a mini bar chart: what
     does it produce (out-edges) vs what produces it (in-edges)?

  e) TRIPLE ANALYSIS — heatmap of (catalyst, product) frequency. Are certain
     catalyst-product pairs robust across substrates, or substrate-dependent?

Phase 3: Look, Think, Iterate

  This is where the actual science happens. Render the graphs. LOOK at them.

  - Is there visible clustering in the production graph?
  - Do any nodes have unusually high connectivity?
  - Are there isolated components (separate ecologies)?
  - Do cycles exist? Are they stable over time or transient?

  Form hypotheses based on what the pictures show. Re-run simulations to test
  them. Zoom in on interesting strands — trace their full production history,
  understand WHY they're interesting by examining the enzyme operations.

Phase 4: Trace Interesting Cases

  When a candidate finding appears (e.g., a mutual pair), drill deep:

  - What are the actual enzyme amino sequences involved?
  - What substrates does the enzyme operate on to produce the partner?
  - Is the relationship robust (works on many substrates) or fragile?
  - Does the pair persist over time or is it transient?
  - Can it be reproduced from different initial conditions?

  This is where findings become explainable, not just statistical.


TOOLS AND SETUP
---------------

- TypeScript simulation: src/model/* already exists, script imports directly
- Python visualization: venv with matplotlib, networkx, numpy
- Image inspection: Claude reads rendered PNGs directly
- Iteration: each cycle is ~2 min (run sim + render + look + think)
- Output directory: analysis/ at project root


WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
-----------------------

The dream: "Here's a production graph from 100k ops. See that cluster of 4
strands? They form an autocatalytic set — each one's enzyme produces the next.
Here's the enzyme trace showing exactly how it works. The set emerged
spontaneously at op ~15k and persisted for the remaining 85k ops. Here are the
amino sequences that make it tick."

The realistic good outcome: "Mutual pairs form but are transient — they last
~500 ops before being disrupted. Here's a typical lifecycle. The production
graph has hub-and-spoke structure, not cycles. Here's what makes a hub."

The honest null result: "The production graph is structureless noise at every
configuration I tried. Cross-strand typogenetics doesn't produce ecological
structure. Here's the evidence, and here's a hypothesis for why."

All three are findings worth sharing.
