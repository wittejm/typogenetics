Close the game loop
- Result strands from processing must be added back to the strand pool
- Only the target strand is consumed; the source strand stays (it produced the enzyme, it isn't destroyed)
- Unless self-targeting: then the strand is consumed once (it's the target)

Allow self-targeting
- Remove the !isSource guard from isValidTarget
- Source strand should show bindable bases when it contains the binding pref
- Clicking source strand body should trigger pulse/bind, not deselect
- Deselection only via clicking the enzyme badge again

Entrance animation for result strands
- When results return to the pool, animate them in (fade/slide)
