═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


FINDING 0: IDENTITY ARTIFACT IN PRODUCTION RECORDING
-----------------------------------------------------
2026-02-14 ~14:15 PT

The first version of the simulation recorded ALL results from enzyme
operations as "production edges" — including cases where the enzyme returned
the substrate unchanged. This made the production graph look dramatically
richer than it actually is.

The worst offender: the `cop` amino (from duplet CG). When an enzyme is just
[cop] (e.g., the strand "CG"), it activates copy mode at the binding position,
writes one complement base to the secondary strand, and terminates. The primary
strand comes back UNCHANGED. The secondary fragment is a single base, which
gets filtered out by filterInert. So CG's enzyme is effectively a no-op.

Before fix → After fix (identity-only edges excluded):
  random200:  315 edges → 191 edges  (39% were identity)
  random500:  596 edges → 425 edges  (29% were identity)
  oldest200:  214 edges →   6 edges  (97% were identity!)
  Cycles:     412 → 14 (random200),  740 → 39 (random500)

LESSON: In any cross-catalysis tracking system, you MUST distinguish "enzyme
returned substrate unchanged" from "enzyme genuinely transformed substrate
into something new." Identity is not production.


FINDING 1: THE C/G ALPHABET TRAP
----------------------------------
2026-02-14 ~14:20 PT

The soup converges to near-total domination by pure C and G strands. After
100k ops, the top ~12 most persistent strands are all pure {C, G}: CC, CG,
GC, GG, GCC, CCC, CGG, GGG, CGC, GCG, GGC, CCG.

Why: The four C/G duplets map to:
  CC → mvl (move left, turn s)
  CG → cop (copy mode, turn r)
  GC → inc (insert C, turn r)
  GG → ing (insert G, turn r)

None of these is 'pun' (punctuation). The duplet AA → pun, which terminates
the current enzyme and starts a new one. Any strand containing A or T risks
having AA somewhere in its duplet sequence, splitting its enzyme chain. Pure
C/G strands have maximal enzyme density — every consecutive pair encodes a
useful amino, no punctuation breaks.

The competitive advantage is simple: C/G strands encode longer, more complex
enzymes per unit length. They also tend to survive filterInert (even CC
encodes [mvl], which is an amino, even though it's nearly useless as a
catalyst).

A and T bases appear only as transients — strands like CA, CT, AC survive
briefly (15-33 snapshots) before being evicted or transformed.

This is a form of ALPHABET REDUCTION: the system spontaneously restricts
itself to a 2-letter subalphabet. This is interesting in its own right but
limits the enzyme repertoire to {mvl, cop, inc, ing} plus combinations.


FINDING 2: THE INSERTION ENZYME ECOSYSTEM
------------------------------------------
2026-02-14 ~14:30 PT

With identity ops excluded, the real productive operations in the soup are
almost exclusively INSERTIONS:

  inc (from GC duplet): Insert C after current position
  ing (from GG duplet): Insert G after current position

These are the only operations available to pure C/G strands that genuinely
modify their substrate. The other C/G operations are:
  cop: Enters copy mode (secondary strand effect, effectively no-op on short strands)
  mvl: Moves cursor left (positioning only, no modification)

The consequence: the dominant "chemistry" of the soup is just "insert C" and
"insert G." Strands grow monotonically — there's no cutting (requires AC
duplet), no deletion (requires AG), no searching. The soup is an insertion-
only world.

This severely limits the possibility of autocatalytic sets, because:
1. No strand can be SHORTENED by a pure C/G catalyst
2. Short strands (GC, GG) must come from somewhere — they're either initial
   pool members or produced by the rare A/T-containing catalysts
3. Without cutting, there's no way to close cycles that require fragmenting
   long strands back into short ones


FINDING 3: GENUINE MUTUAL PAIRS EXIST (BUT ARE STRUCTURALLY DEGENERATE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-14 ~14:40 PT

The strongest genuine mutual production pair is GGG ↔ GGC:

  GGG and GGC both encode: [ing] binds=G (insert G, bind to G)

  GGG produces GGC: GGG's enzyme acts on substrate "GC" → inserts G → "GGC"
  GGC produces GGG: GGC's enzyme acts on substrate "GG" → inserts G → "GGG"

  Co-present in 75/102 snapshots (random200) or 99/102 snapshots (random500).
  Forward: 84-95x, Reverse: 11-95x over 100k ops.

The second strongest pair is GCG ↔ GCC:

  GCG and GCC both encode: [inc] binds=G (insert C, bind to G)

  GCG produces GCC: acts on "GC" → inserts C → "GCC"
  GCC produces GCG: acts on "GG" → inserts C → "GCG"

  Co-present in 66-93/102 snapshots. Forward: 24-47x, Reverse: 3-24x.

These are REAL mutual pairs — A's enzyme produces B, B's enzyme produces A,
both through genuine substrate modification.

BUT: both partners in each pair encode the SAME enzyme. GGG and GGC are
functionally identical ([ing] binds=G). GCG and GCC are functionally identical
([inc] binds=G). The "mutualism" is really "two slightly different strands
that encode the same enzyme and produce each other from abundant short
substrates." The relationship is more like a pair of synonyms than a
complementary partnership.

There are also prominent SELF-PRODUCERS:
  GCC produces GCC: GCC[inc] on "GC" @0 → GCC   (68-73x)
  GGG produces GGG: GGG[ing] on "GG" @0 → GGG   (53-110x)

These are substrate-dependent quasi-replicators. GCC "replicates" by inserting
C into GC. GGG "replicates" by inserting G into GG. They depend entirely on
the substrate being available in the pool.


FINDING 4: EVICTION STRATEGY DETERMINES EVERYTHING
----------------------------------------------------
2026-02-14 ~14:45 PT

  random@200:  103 nodes, 191 edges, 14 cycles, pool stays at cap
  random@500:  290 nodes, 425 edges, 39 cycles, pool stays at cap
  oldest@200:  44 unique, 6 edges, 0 cycles, pool NEVER reaches cap (53/200)
  consumeSource@200:  Collapses to 1 strand within first 1000 ops

Random eviction: Works. Strands persist for tens of thousands of ops.
Structure has time to emerge. The larger cap (500) produces more diverse
cycles and stronger mutual pairs because strands interact more before eviction.

Oldest eviction: Lethal to structure. By definition, old strands are evicted
first, so no strand persists long enough to accumulate production relationships.
The pool stabilizes at only 53 strands (well below the 200 cap) because most
operations are identity (cop/mvl), and the few novel productions get evicted
before they can participate further. 97% of recorded edges were identity.

Consume source: Kills the pool outright. Consuming both catalyst and substrate
means each operation costs 2 strands and produces 1-2, net neutral or negative.
With stochastic effects, the pool quickly collapses.


FINDING 5: POOL COMPOSITION IS STABLE BUT NOT CONVERGED
---------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-14 ~14:50 PT

The pool reaches its cap within the first ~5000 ops and stays there. Unique
strand count stabilizes around 60-65% of cap (125-130 unique out of 200, or
300-340 out of 500). This means ~35-40% of the pool consists of duplicates
of common strands.

The most abundant strand is CC (up to 75 copies in a pool of 500). CC encodes
[mvl] binds=A — a nearly-inert catalyst that moves left and falls off most
short strands. CC survives because:
1. It's produced as a byproduct of many operations
2. It's too short to be meaningfully transformed by insertion
3. It passes filterInert (mvl is technically a valid amino)
4. Random eviction doesn't discriminate against useless strands

CC is the "junk" of this ecosystem — abundant, persistent, catalytically
worthless, but not removed by any selection pressure.


FINDING 6: NO AUTOCATALYTIC SETS FOUND
----------------------------------------
2026-02-14 ~14:55 PT

The dream outcome was an autocatalytic set: A produces B, B produces C, C
produces A, with structurally different enzymes maintaining the cycle.

This was NOT found. The reasons are structural:

1. ALPHABET REDUCTION eliminates enzyme diversity. The soup converges to C/G
   strands, which can only encode {mvl, cop, inc, ing}. Of these, only inc
   and ing are productive. That's TWO distinct catalytic operations, not enough
   for diverse functional complementarity.

2. INSERTION-ONLY CHEMISTRY prevents cycle closure. Insertion enzymes grow
   strands but can't shrink them. For a cycle A→B→C→A to work, at least one
   step would need to shorten a strand (cut, delete). Pure C/G enzymes can't
   do this.

3. UNIVERSAL BINDING PREFERENCE. All four C/G duplets produce enzymes that
   fold to bind G (or occasionally other bases depending on longer sequences).
   This means all C/G enzymes compete for the same binding sites, rather than
   having complementary specificities.

The mutual pairs that do exist (GGG↔GGC, GCG↔GCC) are "degenerate"
autocatalytic pairs — functionally identical enzymes that produce each other
incidentally. They're stable but not interesting in the Kauffman sense.


OPEN QUESTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION
---------------------------------

1. CAN WE BREAK THE C/G TRAP? What if we seed the pool with longer strands
   that contain A/T duplets encoding cut/del/search? Would these survive long
   enough to enable richer chemistry? Perhaps a pool of ONLY strands containing
   AC (cut) and AG (del) as initial conditions.

2. DOES TURNING OFF filterInert HELP? Without filterInert, A/T strands persist
   even if they can't encode enzymes (they're passive substrates). This might
   maintain substrate diversity at the cost of diluting active catalysts.

3. GILLESPIE-STYLE SAMPLING. The current sim wastes ~50% of attempts on
   no-ops (no enzyme, no binding site). Pre-classifying strands and weighting
   selection would increase the density of real interactions.

4. LONGER ENZYMES. The C/G strands that dominate are all short (2-4 bases),
   encoding 1-2 amino enzymes. What about seeding with 10-20 base strands
   that encode 5-10 amino enzymes? These could have cut+insert combos that
   enable cycle closure.

5. COPY MODE DEEP DIVE. The cop amino seems useless on short strands, but
   enzymes like [cop, mvl, cop] (CGCC) could copy multiple bases, producing
   meaningful secondary strand fragments. Has this been explored?


FINDING 7: THE C/G TRAP IS ROBUST TO INITIAL CONDITIONS
---------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-14 ~15:00 PT

Three additional experiments seeding with diverse A/T-containing strands:

  diverse_r200_filterInert:  20 strands including cut+insert, del+insert combos
  diverse_r500_filterInert:  Same pool, larger cap
  diverse_massive_r500:      95 strands with 10x copies of A/T inserters (GA, GT)

ALL THREE converge to the same C/G-dominated ecosystem. The initial GA (insert
A) and GT (insert T) strands, even with 10 copies each, are eliminated within
the first few thousand ops. The top 30 persistent strands are identical to
the standard pool experiments.

Also tested: filterInert OFF with diverse pool. Result: fragmentation death
within seconds — the pool fills with length-1 junk, most attempts fail to
produce enzymes, simulation grinds to a halt. Confirms the quest doc's warning.

The C/G trap is a STRUCTURAL ATTRACTOR of this system:
1. C/G strands have maximal enzyme density (no AA punctuation)
2. The dominant enzymes (inc, ing) only insert C and G, reinforcing the trap
3. Cut and del enzymes from A/T strands fragment things into C/G-rich pieces
4. Even A/T-inserting enzymes (ina from GA, int from GT) can't overcome the
   mass production of C/G strands by the dominant insertion enzymes

This is perhaps the most important finding: Hofstadter's duplet→amino mapping
creates an inherent asymmetry between {C,G} and {A,T} that drives the system
toward a reduced alphabet regardless of initial conditions.


FINDING 8: COPY MODE REPLICATION
----------------------------------
2026-02-14 ~15:05 PT

Brief investigation of copy mode. CGCC encodes [cop, mvl] binds=G. This
enzyme: (1) enters copy mode at G, writing complement to secondary, (2) moves
left, writing complement at new position. On substrate "CG" bound at the G:

  Primary: C G     → unchanged: "CG"
  Secondary: G C   → reversed: "CG"

Result: ["CG", "CG"] — two copies from one. Genuine replication through copy
mode. CGCC acting on CG doubles the CG count in the pool.

However, CGCC is not very persistent (max 17 consecutive snapshots, count ~5).
It's present in the pool but not dominant. The reason: CGCC's replication of
CG competes with the identity operation where CG's own cop enzyme returns CG
unchanged. The net effect is that CG is abundant anyway.

Copy mode becomes more powerful with longer movement sequences (more positions
copied), but the C/G trap limits enzyme length and diversity.


SESSION 1 SUMMARY
-------------------
2026-02-14 ~15:10 PT

The typogenetics soup with cross-strand interactions produces SOME ecological
structure — genuine mutual production pairs, self-producing quasi-replicators,
hub-and-spoke production graphs — but falls short of autocatalytic sets.

The central finding is the C/G ALPHABET TRAP: Hofstadter's duplet mapping
creates a 2-letter subalphabet ({C,G}) that dominates all other bases because:
(a) no punctuation, (b) self-reinforcing insertion enzymes, (c) maximal enzyme
density. This limits the enzyme repertoire to two genuinely productive
operations (insert C, insert G), which is too impoverished for the diverse
functional complementarity that autocatalytic sets require.

The trap is robust to initial conditions, pool size, and seeding strategy.
It may be an inherent property of the specific duplet→amino table Hofstadter
chose, rather than of typogenetics in general.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
2026-02-14 15:14 PT  SESSION 2 — Cross-Alphabet Table & Gillespie
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


FINDING 9: CROSS-ALPHABET TABLE BREAKS THE C/G TRAP
-----------------------------------------------------
2026-02-14 15:10 PT

Jordan's idea: swap the insertion targets in the duplet table so that C/G
enzymes insert A/T and vice versa. Four entries changed:

  Standard:  GC→inc(C)  GG→ing(G)  GA→ina(A)  GT→int(T)
  Cross:     GC→ina(A)  GG→int(T)  GA→inc(C)  GT→ing(G)

Result: the C/G trap is COMPLETELY BROKEN. After 500k ops (Gillespie, cap 500):

  Standard table: 64 strands, 61 unique, 39 production edges
  Cross table:    500 strands, 403 unique, 345 production edges

The cross table maintains ALL FOUR BASES in persistent strands. The top
persistent strands include ALL 16 possible 2-base combinations:
CC, TT, GG, TC, AC, GT, GC, TG, TA, CA, CG, CT, GA, AG, AT.

No single alphabet dominates. Max count for any strand is ~100 (transient)
vs 75+ persistent C/G dominance in standard table.

WHY IT WORKS: The cross table creates mandatory mutualism between alphabets.
C/G enzymes insert A and T (cross-pollinating into the other alphabet), so
they can't self-reinforce. A/T enzymes insert C and G, maintaining the
"other" bases. Each alphabet needs the other to persist. No monoculture is
self-sustaining.


FINDING 10: GENUINE AUTOCATALYTIC TRIANGLE DISCOVERED
------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-14 15:12 PT

The Gillespie cross-table run at 500k ops produced 8 cycles. The strongest:

  GA → GGAC → AC → GA    (weight 223)

This is a REAL autocatalytic cycle with THREE DIFFERENT enzyme operations:

  GA  = [inc | binds A]        — inserts C (cross: GA→inc, not ina)
  GGAC = [int, cut | binds G]  — inserts T then cuts
  AC  = [cut | binds A]        — cuts

Traced mechanism:

  Step 1: GA acts on substrate "GGA", inserts C after A → produces GGAC
  Step 2: GGAC acts on substrate "GAC", inserts T then cuts → produces AC + GT
  Step 3: AC acts on substrate "GAT", cuts after A → produces GA + T

Three strands, three different enzymes, three different substrates, two
different binding preferences (A and G). Each step uses a DIFFERENT catalytic
operation (insert C, insert T + cut, cut). The cycle closes.

SUBSTRATE AVAILABILITY: The substrates (GGA, GAC, GAT) are themselves
produced by pool members:
  - GGA is produced by GC[ina|G] acting on "GG" → inserts A → "GGA"
  - GAC is produced by GA[inc|A] acting on "GA" → inserts C → "GAC"
  - GAT is produced by various A-containing substrates being cut

This means the FULL system including substrates is self-sustaining: the cycle
members produce each other, and the substrates they need are maintained by
the broader pool's cross-alphabet dynamics.

BONUS: AC[cut|A] on "GAGA" → [GA, GA]. This is a MULTIPLICATION event —
one substrate produces TWO copies of a cycle member. The cycle can amplify.


FINDING 11: GILLESPIE SAMPLING REVEALS TRUE DYNAMICS
------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-14 15:13 PT

Gillespie-style sampling (pick catalyst first, then find compatible target)
achieves 100% productive ops — every attempt succeeds. This is dramatically
more efficient:

  Standard random×random: ~50% hit rate (200k attempts for 100k ops)
  Gillespie: 100% hit rate (500k attempts = 500k ops)

But the more important effect: Gillespie reveals the TRUE steady state. With
the standard table, Gillespie shows the pool collapses to just 64 strands
(well below the 500 cap) — proving that the C/G ecosystem is impoverished
even when given maximum opportunity to interact. The 50% waste in random
sampling was masking how few real interactions occur.

With the cross table, Gillespie at 500 cap maintains 403 unique strands.
The system is genuinely diverse, not just noisy.

     reliably or was a lucky one-shot
  2. LONGER CYCLES — extend cycle search to length 5-6, look for larger
     autocatalytic sets
  3. STABILITY ANALYSIS — does the triangle persist once formed? Track its
     members' pool counts over time, look for emergence/collapse events
  4. PARAMETER SWEEP on cross table — vary cap size (100-2000), try
     consume-source, oldest eviction. Find optimal conditions for cycles.
